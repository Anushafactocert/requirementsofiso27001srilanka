![REQUIREMENTS FOR ISO 27001 CERTIFICATION IN SRI LANKA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89084770/155515542-dca2ec30-0ac0-441d-976d-e4a9917d3e2c.png)

In Sri Lanka, ISO 27001 Certification, commonly known as the Information Security Management System standard, has quickly become the global standard for information security management systems (ISMS).

The standard specifies four major ISMS components, which are as follows:

Risk management

Information security organisation,
 
Asset management, and
 
Risk management involves all areas of training and communication.
 
ISO 27001 Certification covers documentation requirements and various standards on other aspects of information security management, such as privacy and regulatory challenges.

What is ISO 27001 all about?

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has created a standard that firms can set up an information security management system (ISMS).

ISO 27001 is a worldwide recognised standard that focuses on creating controls to manage, protect, and monitor information security inside organisations.

As an ISO 27001-certified firm, you will be able to demonstrate your dedication to data security. Though it takes time and effort to get started, it is worthwhile - just around 1% of all organisations in Sri Lanka have ISO 27001 Certification.

What are the advantages of certification?

If your company handles sensitive data or controls critical infrastructure, ISO 27001 certification is required.

In Sri Lanka, several industries, including healthcare and finance, require ISO 27001 certification.

If you do international business, getting ISO 27001 Certification in Sri Lanka would distinguish your firm from the competitors and make conducting business overseas easier.

Obtaining ISO 27001 certification does not indicate that you have policies and procedures to ensure that your data is secure and accessible when needed.

It also shows that consumers, clients, investors, and others are worried about information security, which is critical for everyone who deals with personally identifiable information (PII).

What are the ISO 27001 certification requirements in Sri Lanka?

The required prerequisites for acquiring ISO 27001 Certification in Sri Lanka are as follows:

Assemble an implementation team:

Your first responsibility is to choose a task leader to oversee the ISMS deployment. They must be educated about security issues and have the power to lead a group and issue supervisors with orders.

Create a plan of action:

Then it would help if you started planning for the actual implementation.

The execution team will devote the necessary time and effort to developing a comprehensive list of safety and security reasons, a strategy, and a risk register.

Start the ISMS:

Now that the plan has been established, it is time to decide which continuous improvement approach to employ.

In Sri Lanka, ISO 27001 certification supports a "process method" rather than a specific strategy.

It's a never-ending cycle of Plan-Do-Check-Act. Any design may be employed as long as the needs and procedures are clearly described, well carried out, and constantly analysed and improved.

A team of individuals will be required to assist the task leader. Senior management may choose the group or delegate it to the team leader.

Define the ISMS's scope:

The next step is to grasp the ISMS's structure.

As a result, you should analyze everything your company need to guarantee that the ISMS fulfils your requirements.

Recognize your baseline for safety and security:

The organization's safety standard establishes the bare minimum of activity required to run a business.

Using the information gleaned from your ISO 27001 risk assessment, you may create your safety standard.

It will aid you in identifying your organization's most critical security problems and the ISO 27001 control to mitigate the risk.

Create a risk-monitoring procedure:

Risk management is at the core of an ISMS. Establish a risk-monitoring procedure.

Almost every component of your safety and security system is dependent on the risks you've identified and prioritized; hence, risk management is an essential skill for any company pursuing ISO 27001 Certification in Sri Lanka.

Typical strategies focus on threats to specific assets or publicly articulated concerns.

Create a risk-management strategy:

The execution of the risk management strategy involves security measures to safeguard your organization's information assets.

To ensure the efficiency of these procedures, the team must be able to work or interact with management while also being aware of their information security duties.

Measure, monitor, and evaluate:

You won't know if your ISMS is working or not unless you assess it. We recommend doing this at least once a year to guarantee that you can maintain a careful watch on the developing hazards.

The evaluation approach comprises identifying criteria that correspond to the objectives you outlined in the job description.

A standard metric is a quantitative investigation in which a number is assigned to whatever is determined. It is useful when using items that have monetary or time expenses.

Validate your ISMS:

Once the ISMS is in place, you may decide to pursue ISO 27001 Certification in Sri Lanka, in which case you must prepare for an external audit.
